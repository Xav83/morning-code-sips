Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://brew.sh/2024/05/14/homebrew-4.3.0/">Homebrew 4.3.0</a></h3>

If you are on MacOS, you probably know about Homebrew: "The Missing Package Manager".

The most significant changes since 4.2.0 are SBOM support, initial bottle attestation verification, new command analytics and uninstall autoremove by default.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp">Zelda 64: Recompiled</a></h3>

Zelda 64: Recompiled is a project that uses <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a> to statically recompile Majora's Mask (and soon Ocarina of Time) into a native port with many new features and enhancements.
This project uses <a href="https://github.com/rt64/rt64">RT64</a> as the rendering engine to provide some of these enhancements.

<h3><a href="https://www.codingfont.com/">CodingFont by Typogram</a></h3>

As software engineers, we spend a lot of time skimming, reading, making changes to code.
The coding font that we spend 8 hours a day staring at has a lot to do with our productivity and comfort.
This website gamifies the experience to help us find your true love of coding fonts!

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
