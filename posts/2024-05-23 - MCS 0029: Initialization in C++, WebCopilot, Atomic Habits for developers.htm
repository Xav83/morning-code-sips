Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/ckwastra/77b0e67ed157fc1038b167c0a9b546db">Initialization in C++</a></h3>

A really interesting experiment on the difference between copy-initialization (e.g. in return statements) and direct-initialization (e.g. in static_cast expressions).
This is also a good reminder about why you should try to be up to date with your compiler.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/h4r5h1t/webcopilot">WebCopilot</a></h3>

An automation tool that enumerates subdomains then filters out xss, sqli, open redirect, lfi, ssrf and rce parameters and then scans for vulnerabilities. 
This tool can really improve your life if you work in security, as a lot of tedious task will be automated with it!
