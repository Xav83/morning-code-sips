<h3><a href="https://blog.conan.io/2024/03/21/Introducing-new-conan-visual-studio-extension.html">New Conan Visual Studio Extension</a></h3>

Conan is a package manager for C++ developers, and they just release an extension in order to simplify the integration of their tool in Visual Studio.
I find the example project they used really cool: a program which can download an image from the web as ASCII art in the console !
