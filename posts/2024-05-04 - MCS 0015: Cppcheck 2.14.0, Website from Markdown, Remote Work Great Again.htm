Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/releases/tag/2.14.0">Cppcheck 2.14.0</a></h3>

CppCheck is a tool that can analyse C++ code and indicates if some issues are present.
A new release is available, and 2 new checks are now present:
- eraseIteratorOutOfBounds: warns when erase() is called on an iterator that is out of bounds
- returnByReference: warns when a large class member is returned by value from a getter function

<h3><a href="https://docsify-this.net/#/">Docsify-this: Your website using Markdown</a></h3>

This open-source web app provides a quick way to publish one or more online Markdown files as standalone web pages without needing to set up your own website.

<h3><a href="https://leadshorizons.com/p/make-remote-work-great-again">Make Remote Work, Great Again</a></h3>

This really interesting article talks about the benefit of remote work, and all the ways you can improve your expenrice with remote workers or when you are working remotely.
Personnally, I was sceptical about virtual offices, but after seing the video embedded in this article, I will probably give it a try!

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
