Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/rovertronic/Mario-Builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a></h3>

Mario Builder 64 is a Super Mario 64 ROM hack that allows you to create custom levels in-game.
You can also find the [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUFL5ObkxCY&list=PLaUXZ0xl9h1U4e4s1tvT_0iazHfA2HB_m&index=9) to go along with the new release of the project.
Can wait to try it out !! 

<h3><a href="https://frankforce.com/city-in-a-bottle-a-256-byte-raycasting-system/">City In A Bottle: A 256 Byte Raycasting System</a></h3>

This article is about a small snippet of code which is able to render a city with only a 256 byte HTML file.
A really impressive performance !
And it allowed me to encounter the work of Frank Force, who have done a <a href="https://dweetview.3d2k.com/?user=KilledByAPixel&awesome=1">lot of other small programs</a> really mesmering to watch.

<h3><a href="https://vzalzal.com/posts/noisy-the-class-you-wrote-a-hundred-times/">Noisy: The Class You Wrote a Hundred Times</a></h3>

If, like me, you are a C++ developer, you have probably already written a similar class, in order to track which constructors are used, and how many times.
And if we can start all using the same class to do it, we will probably improve our debugging experience as developers, since we will all have the same denomination for it.
All that thanks to <a href="https://github.com/VincentZalzal">Vincent Zalzal</a>!

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
