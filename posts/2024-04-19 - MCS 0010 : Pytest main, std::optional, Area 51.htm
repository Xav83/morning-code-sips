Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://dev.to/sk_rajibul_9ce58a68c43bb5/simplifying-test-execution-with-pytestmain-2hc2">Simplifying Test Execution with pytest.main()</a></h3>

This article explains all the use you can have of the function 'pytest.main'.
Since I am currently leveling up my knowledge of the python language/environment, this article comes at the perfect time &#x1F604;

<h3><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/stdoptional">std::optional</a></h3>

In this article, you will find a lot of information about how to use the structure 'std::optional' available since C++17.
This structure is really interesting as it can be use to achieve different purpose such as optional function parameter or return value.
A structure you must know if you want to take full advantage of the C++17 features.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/ProjectDreamland/area51">Area 51 (2005): Source Code Release</a></h3>

You may be familiar with this video game 'Area 51'.
If so, you may be interested to look at the game code source, which is now available on GitHub for you to play with! &#x1F609;

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
