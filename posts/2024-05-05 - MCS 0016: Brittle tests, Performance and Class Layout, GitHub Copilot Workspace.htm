Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/04/how-i-learned-to-stop-writing-brittle.html">No to Brittle Tests</a></h3>

This article from the Google Testing Blog introduces the concept of Brittle test, which is a test that fails not for real problems, and Expressive API.
I really love the second one because, I always try to aim to expressivity when I write my code, in order to simplify the work of the people that will come across it in the futur.
And it gives me the satisfaction of a work well done.

<h3><a href="https://johnnysswlab.com/software-performance-and-class-layout/">Software Performance and Class Layout</a></h3>

If you are working with C or C++ code, then, this article may interest you.
This is an extensive article about the influence of class/structure layout on the performance of a software.
This can be really pertinent for embedeed developers, for example.

<h3><a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/">GitHub Copilot Workspace</a></h3>

Wow, if this product works as this article shows, the developers experience on GitHub is going to be revolutionized.
Personnally, I am already signup on the <a href="https://github.com/github-copilot/workspace_waitlist_signup/join">waiting list</a>!
I strongly advise you to do it too. &#x1F609;
