Today, we are Sunday, and today we need relax!

Actually, since I'll be on the road tomorrow all day, I am going to plan the next article, so that you will have some fresh news to check tomorrow morning.
Since you are here, I might as well tease you what the article will be about: Enum to string, Sonic port, Pointless meetings.

Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
