Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://github.blog/2024-03-20-found-means-fixed-introducing-code-scanning-autofix-powered-by-github-copilot-and-codeql/">GitHub: Found means fixed</a></h3>

Now in public beta for GitHub Advanced Security customers, code scanning autofix helps developers remediate more than two-thirds of supported alerts with little or no editing.
A very interesting new tool to make our code safer by default, in our day to day life.

<h3><a href="https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/production-driven-development-an-approach-for-highly/">Production Driven Development</a></h3>

This article is a great introduction to the paradigm of "Production Driven Development".
This is an approaches to testing and development focused on production, in order to iterate rapidly on your product, and be ahead of your competition.

<h3><a href="https://www.elopezr.com/life-and-death-of-a-graphics-programmer/">Life and Death of a Graphics Programmer</a></h3>

A really interesting article about the problematics graphics developers encounter.
This is focus on the C++ language, so it can be very technical if you are not used to this language ^^

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;
