Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://pretendo.network/blog/4-8-24">The Future of Pretendo After Nintendo Network</a></h3>

Pretendo is an open-source project that aims to recreate Nintendo Network for the 3DS and Wii U using clean-room reverse engineering.
And now that Nintendo is discontinuing their servers for Wii U and 3DS's servers, this project become one of all the possibilities if you want to play online with those consoles.
A project interesting to follow.

<h3><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-shift-left-in-software">What Does "Shift Left" Mean in Software Development?</a></h3>

In our domain, being aware of how a project is created from end to end is important, and knowing about the concepts related to software development is also important.
With that in mind, "Shift Left" is a really important concept as it can also impact how you organize your work in order to detect issues the earlier possible. 

<h3><a href="https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/posts/cpp/1115">Static analyzer nudges you to write clean code</a></h3>

Another great article from PVS-Studio, about the importance of using static analisis tools.
Code quality tends to be discarded in an attempt to reduce the time to market of a product.
Sadly, this is a price the developers in charge of the maintainance will pay, since they will have when resolving the bugs found by clients, and potentially bad reviews from their customers.
