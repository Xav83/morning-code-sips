Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://abseil.io/tips/224">Tip of the Week #224: Avoid vector.at()</a>, on Abseil.io</h3>

The title is pretty straightforward about it subject. If you've been using C++ for some time, you may have already come to the same conclusion.
I find this article very useful to give to new comers in a project, when they are not aware of this.

<h3><a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-09-4-ways-github-engineers-use-github-copilot/">4 ways GitHub engineers use GitHub Copilot</a>, from GitHub blog</h3>

You may see it all over social media, the AI coming to take the job of every programmer (media loves the sensational).
In this article, how AI can actually serve us, as developer. The use case mentionned can totally be adapted to any AI Chatbot (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Mistral AI, ...).

<h3><a href="https://inkandvolt.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-weekly-reflection">5 Benefits of Weekly Reflection</a>, from ink+volt</h3>

I always enjoy the articles on ink+volt. I don't know why, but they have a peacefull and feel good effect on me.
This article details, as the title suggests, 5 benefits of Weekly Reflection, a routine that I should definitly set up (on day, maybe).
