For the first post of this new series, and as a starter for the day, today, I propose to you 2 very interesting articles, to go along with your first bevrage of the day. 

<h3><a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0705r0.html">Implicit and Explicit Conversions</a>: Paper NÂ°P0705R0 from open-std.org</h3>

This document dives into the differences between explicit and implicit conversions in C++ and when we should prefer one or the other.
You will find in there a table which can be handy if you want to share the conclusion of this article with the rest of your team, for example.
I'm definitely going to use it !

<h3><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/04/prefer-narrow-assertions-in-unit-tests.html">Prefer Narrow Assertions in Unit Tests</a>: an adaptation from a Google Testing on the Toilet episode</h3>

This small post details why we should use narrow assertions when writing tests, with a concrete example.
Even if the example used is a C++ one (with the GTest library), the logic exposed in this post can actually be used no matter the library and the language used to write the tests.

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;
Now I have to share them with my team at work, as this can probably improve our code a lot.

Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
