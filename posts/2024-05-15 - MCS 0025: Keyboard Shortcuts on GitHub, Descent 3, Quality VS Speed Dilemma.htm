Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-19-a-short-guide-to-mastering-keyboard-shortcuts-on-github">Keyboard Shortcuts on GitHub</a></h3>

I didn't know there are so much shortcuts on GitHub, I only knew a couple of them, but wow.
Since I pass a lot of time on GitHub, this is going to be really handy.
I am definitly going to use the 'CTRL-K' one a lot !!!

<h3><a href="https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3">Descent 3 Engine Open Sourced</a></h3>

For context, Descent 3 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Outrage Entertainment, published by Interplay Entertainment and was originally released for Microsoft Windows in North America on June 17, 1999.
And the code of the game engine has been open sourced last month, giving us a look about how this game was made.
Since them, some people have worked on it in order to make it available to everyone on all platform.

<h3><a href="https://shiftmag.dev/the-dilemma-of-quality-versus-speed-is-false-3310/">The Quality VS Speed Dilemma</a></h3>

The Dilemma of 'Quality VS Speed Dilemma' is the hypothesis stating that you can either build a quality software slowly or build a software quickly but with a poor quality of code.

This article defends the idea that this is actually a false dilemma.
It states that if you write code with good quality, you will iterate quickly on your code whereas if you write poor quality code, making changes will be slower and slower over time.
Personnally, I tend to agree with this article.

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
