Today, we are Sunday, and today I relax, so I'll just give you a link to get the document I have created.
It contains the table from the <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/Xav83/morning-code-sips/d38fd995c2eb82be50932a49742b0e99274c1888/resources/Implicit%20or%20Explicit%20Conversions.pdf">Implicit and Explicit Conversions paper</a>, so that you can easily have access to it, share it with your team and print to display it in your office.

Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
