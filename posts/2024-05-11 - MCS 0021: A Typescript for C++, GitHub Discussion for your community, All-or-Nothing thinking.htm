<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJvPBHErF2U">A Typescript for C++</a></h3>

In this videoconference, Herb Sutter talks to us about the future of C++.
His experimental project cppfront is very interesting as it shows us, what a "safer C++" could look like.
He also emphasis on the value for any language wanting to be the "futur C++" to be fully compatible with C++, like C++ with C or Typescript with Javascript.

<h3><a href="https://github.blog/2024-05-06-create-a-home-for-your-community-with-github-discussions/">GitHub Discussions for your community</a></h3>

GitHub Community-in-a-box provides the tooling, resources, and knowledge you need to build internal communities of learning at scale with GitHub Discussions.
This article goes into how you can actually use this part of your GitHub repository so that your community and your developers are as close as they can be from one another.

<h3><a href="https://joedemoraes.com/2024/05/10/the-impact-of-all-or-nothing-thinking-in-software-engineering/">The Impact of All-or-Nothing Thinking in Software Engineering</a></h3>

When working on the software industry, you may encounter the All-or-Nothing mindset, either from yourself, somebody else or even an entire team or company.
