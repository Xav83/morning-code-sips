Today, I propose the 3 following articles to start your day.

<h3><a href="https://johnnysswlab.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-explicit-software-prefetching/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-pros-and-cons-of-explicit-software-prefetching">The pros and cons of explicit software prefetching</a></h3>

This article, by Johnny's Software Lab, is a great introduction to software prefetching when using C or C++.
This is a tool that is not necessary for everyone, but can be very powerful when you need to optimise for performance.
But keep in mind that nothing can replace mesuring the performance in order to validate modification for performance.
Indeed, as explained in this article, software prefetching can be great when done at the best place and time, but can be useless if done where it is not necessary.

<h3><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2024/03/whats-in-name.html">What's in a Name?</a></h3>

This article, from Google testing blog, is a great reminder of the importance of naming when developping software.
A good name can make the life of everyone encountering the piece of code, by making it clear about its purpose, while a bad one can either be unclear about what the code does or even be misleading.
I actually wrote an article on the same subject about 4 years ago: <a href="https://10xlearner.com/2020/01/21/the-power-of-naming-code-craft/">The Power Of Naming</a>.

<h3><a href="https://dev.to/cougarred1/what-is-event-bubbling-3jkk">What is event bubbling?</a></h3>

A great article detailing very clearly the concept of event bubbling with some simple Javascript example.
All we need to learn this concept !

I hope you enjoyed those articles as much as your morning bevrage, and that they gave you some interesting knowledge.
Personnally, I read them while drinking my first cup of coffee of the day &#9749;


Have a splendid day, and see you in the next Morning Code Sip articles. &#128512;
